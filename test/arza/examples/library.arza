//
//This program represents a repository of citation information, containing books, articles and journals
//with action of formatting those books for consumption on demand.
//
//Let's take two approaches to formatting. National Library of Medicine (derived from the Vancouver Project)
//specifies citations in a particular way, mostly affecting how author names are laid out.
//NLM differs from American Psychological Association (APA) formatting.
//
//Also we have to publish these citations and choice of outputs are: plain text, PDF, HTML.
//Some of these items require different layout strategies,
//depending on the type of the format (APA indents following lines, NLM doesn't).

// Declaring interfaces

interface Repo(I) =
    add(I, item)

interface Source(I) =
    format(item of I, format_standart, output_format)

interface Standart(I) =
    use format(item, format_standart of I, output_format)

interface Output(I) =
    use format(item, format_standart, output_format of I)

fun format_books(library) =
    let books = seq:map(library.books, format)

// Declaring types

type Item(author, name)
type Record(id, item)
type Book is Item
type Article is Item
type Journal is Item
